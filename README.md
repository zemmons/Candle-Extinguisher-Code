# Candle-Extinguisher-Code
# Between 2009 and 2013, nearly 10,000 fires were started 
directly due to a candle being left lit. In these fires, over 800 people perished. Because of this, it could be a
great idea to make a safe, reliable candle extinguisher that is user friendly and
reliable.
# Essential Questions in Making your Design:
1. What is the candle you are extinguishing? Tall candle? Yankee candle? Tea
light? What is the one you are designing for? This will affect how you
structure your design.
2. How does your extinguisher know when to go off? Is it on a timer? A
sensor?
3. How will it extinguish the flame? What method of movement will allow you to
write a working program that can accomplish this?
4. How can we make sure our design is user friendly? What kind of
markings/packaging/design is essential to make sure that this device is
universally understood?
